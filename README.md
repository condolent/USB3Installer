# -WIP- USB3Installer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/condolent/USB3Installer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/condolent/USB3Installer)

### About
This is a software made in Java, that lets the user choose a windows 7 operating system setup .iso-file and installs USB-3 drivers into the setup for them. Which prevents the issue where you try to install windows on a PC with USB 3-ports only, causing your keyboard and mouse not working.

This software is originally made for my work, where we've encountered this issue lots of times.  
But if you need this aswell, you're more than welcome to use it for your own use!

### Source files
I've uploaded the source-files here because I want people contributing to the project by adding functions and such. If there's a function you see missing that you'd like, and you know Java, then feel free to contribute and implement said function.
